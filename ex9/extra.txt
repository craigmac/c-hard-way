Break it:
b1 - Forget to init first int i. Depending on what i starts with, the loop might not
run at all, or run for a very long time.
b2 - forget to init the second loop's i so that it retains the value from end
of the first loop. Now your second loop might or might not run.
b3 - forget to do a i++ increment at the end of the loop and you'll get a
infinite loop. What happens?

Extra credit:
e1 - make the loop count backward by using i-- starting at 25 and going to 0.
e2 - write a few more complex while-loops using what you know so far.
