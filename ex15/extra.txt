How to Break it:
* Try to make cur_age point at names. You'll need to use a C cast to force it,
so go look that up and try to figure it out.
* In the last for-loop, try getting the math wrong in weird ways.
* Try rewriting the loops so that they start at the end of the arrays and go
to the beginning. This is harder than it looks.

Extra credit:
e1 - rewrite all of the arrays in this program as pointers.
e2 - rewrite all of the pointers as arrays.
e3 - go back to some of the other programs that use arrays and try to use
pointers instead.
e4 - process cmd line args using just pointers similar to how you did
'names' in this one.
e5 - play with combos of getting the value of and the address of things.
e6 - add another for-loop at the end that prints out the addresses that
these pointers are using. You'll need the %p printf formatter.
e7 - rewrite this program to use a function for each of the ways you're
printing out things. Try to pass pointers to these functions so that
they work on the data. Remember you can declare a function to accept
a pointer, but just use it like an array.
e8 - change the for-loops to while-loops and see what works better for
which kind of pointer usage.
