How to break it:
* Remove forward declarations to confuse compiler and cause it to complain
about functions
* Try adding 1 to argc in main()'s print_arguments() so it goes past
end of argv array. Debug it with gdb/lldb.

Extra credit:
e1 - Rewrite so can_print_it() is not needed
e2 - have print_arguments figure out how long each arg string is by using the
strlen() function, and then pass that length to print_letters(). Then rewrite
print_letters() so it only processes this fixed length and doesn't rely on the
'\0' terminator. You'll need to include <string.h> for this.
e3 - Use man to look up isalpha() and isblank(). Use similar functions to print
out only digits or other characters.
e4 - Read about how others format their functions. Avoid K&R syntax.
