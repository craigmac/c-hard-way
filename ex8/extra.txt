Break it:
b1 - Remove the else at the end, and the program won't catch the edge case.
b2 - Change the && and || so you get an or instead of an and test and see how that
works.

Extra credit:
e1 - Research online the different boolean operators.
e2 - write a few more test cases for this program.
e3 - is the first test really saying the right thing? To you the first arg, 0, is
not the same as the first arg the user entered. Fix it.
